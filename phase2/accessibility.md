# Accessibility

1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes 
explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any 
such features you can either:

    (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

    (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

7 PRINCIPLES:

Equitable Use:
   We made our program web based to rely on the default web and OS features such as Text-to-Speech as 
   we did not have enough time to implement our own features for better equitable use.
   Having our own features would allow us to not have to rely on compatibility with third party 
   software making our overall program more disability friendly. Lastly, we are keeping our UI as minimal
   as possible without compromising too much on how intuitive and appealing it is. A minimal UI will
   reduce the risk of user stress from an abundance of information and allow epileptic users to not worry.

Flexibility in Use:
   Our program is easy to use. In the UI we made the color scheme in order to have a clear contrast
   between information and its backgrounds so that users do not have to guess what is being said but can 
   easily read the data. Furthermore, the buttons made are of a large size to ensure ease on interaction
   between itself and the user.

Simple and Intuitive Use:
   Like previously mentioned, we kept our program UI to a minimalistic architectural design so that there
   are no instances of information overflow on the screen confusing our clients. Buttons have clear
   labels and the structure of the webpages all intuitively make sense.

Perceptible Information:
   The program ensures that the important information stands out from the surroundings through use of
   contrasting colors and changing the weight of the font. When it comes to images, we have made it so
   that upon hovering, a title for the image pops up and the user is able to read it. For example, if the
   user has a hard time perceiving images but not text, then they can hover over the logo (an image) and
   it will say "logo". However, in more serious cases of visual impairment, as previously mentioned,
   we are relying on third party software for this.

Tolerance for Error:
   In terms of code errors, we have ensured that there is a failsafe so that no matter what the user
   inputs the program will not crash but instead an indication of what they or us did wrong would be
   shown. However, if a user decides to (for example) delete a piece of information, there is no way to
   get it back. We have only implemented a confirmation stage upon delete button interactions as to limit
   the accidental clicking factors.

Low Physical Effort:
   Our program does not require abnormal physical strain. The user only needs to input what they need
   to store and nothing more than a couple clicks to secure the information. We have even implemented
   a password generator to help the user find a suitable password (which we keep no record of) to secure
   their private information. It also rates the user's password ideas to ensure that they have a good fit.

Size and Space for Approach and Use:
   The user has a large panel where the main information they want to see will appear. This panel will
   only open up once the label located on the side menu bar is selected. This allows the user to have
   all the visual space that they need to view the large text displayed for them.

3. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license 
your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such 
as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.


   I would have "people with needs to safeguard digital notes, passwords, or other forms of texts".

   What I mean by this is that our program offers a way to digitally store sensitive data that the user
   might not want to risk forgetting or writing on paper. We can view this as a personal digital data 
   bank/vault system. For example, someone with a medical condition that affects their memeory might forget their SIN, 
   so they could store it securely in our program. Also, anyone who has a digital footprint that needs to log in anywhere could benefit from our program. It is advised that you should not
   repeat passwords, and given the amount of passwords that most people use, it is unreasonable to remember a new password for every website that you log on to. 
   So a password manager would help protect people who are not able to remember such large amounts of information and people suceptible to memory loss. 
   

5. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain 
demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a 
braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.


   This program would less likely be used by an older demographic as they tend to not be inclined towards
   digital methods of function. However, we could also infer that they are the most likely to need such
   a program as with age, memory declines and the older demographic doesn't have a clear understanding of
   the digital world and could therefore benefit from the password generator feature. This program is also 
   less likely to be used by non-English speakers, since we only offer this program in English, and someone
   who only speaks French would not be able to understand the user interface.
