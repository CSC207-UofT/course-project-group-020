This pull request includes the first implementation of the Controller class. In this 
PR, Spring boot is integrated into the project through gradle and all the required 
java files are create. the POST and GET requests were created and implemented, although
they will be later changed to better fit with the Clean Architecure. Furthermore, the 
Factory Design Pattern was implemented in this PR as well. Without this PR, the backend
would stay disconnected from the frontend.
