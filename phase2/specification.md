# Specification

MonKeyPass is a multi-user application that securely stores and retrieves sensitive data for its accounts. The user can create new accounts, sign in to an account, sign out of an account, and delete their account. To create a new account, the user must set a username and a master password. The password is hashed (one-way encrypted) as a security measure. Each account can store entries of login information, notes, contacts, and/or identification information. The entries in each account are private to the other accounts and are also only accessible to the user when they are signed in. Each entry is encrypted using the plaintext of the master password and serialized.

When the user is creating a new login entry, the application gives the user the option to generate a strong password based on an algorithm developed in-file. The user can access the entries they have stored through the main menu of the application, which displays all the entries of the data that the manager is currently storing. The entry is accessed by decrypting the ciphertext from the serialized bin file and displayed for the user. Furthermore, any given entry of any type can be also edited and deleted by the user. An exception to this is when the user is accessing login information. In that case, the password is displayed in asterisks but it can be revealed by clicking the monkey icon.
